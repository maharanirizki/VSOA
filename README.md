# Vendor Selection and Order Allocation (VSOA) Tutorial

In supply chain management (SCM) creating a strategic partnership with suppliers/vendor plays an important role to maximize SCM performance. A VSOA happen when a company needs to choose which vendor to allocate orders for producing products. The main three objectives of VSOA are **maximizing perfomance, minimizing risk, and minimizing cost**. VSOA in supply chain located in the tactical level and strategic level.

### Problem Characteristics
VSOA problem has several characteristics as follows:
* Long-term strategy and planning
* Multiple outsourcing vendors consideration
* Selecting fewer vendors
* Multiple criteria and objectives for evaluation
* Criteria including qualitative and quantitative, subjective or objective
* Determining suitable order quantity as the purpose
* High uncertainty and risk in selection procedure

## Methodology
This tutorial use integer programming to solve the problem using Gurobi

## Example and Applications
The example used in this tutorial will be based on the data provided by
